## Lesson Notes

- **PWA:** A _Progressive Web App (PWA)_ is a web application that has the feel and functionality of an actual native/mobile phone app. PWA's are also enhanced with modern API's to deliver advanced features such as the ability for a user to install the website on any device.

- **Service Worker:** A _Service Worker_ is a script that the browser downloads and runs in the background, seperate from the main thread of the webpage, opening the door to features that don't need to work with the webpage or user interaction. These features include, but are not limited to, _push notifications_, _background sync_, and supporting offline experiences!

## Animations - Course Project Steps

### STEP 1: Setting up Angular for Animations

_app.module.ts file_:

- Import `{BrowserAnimationsModule}` from "@angular/platform-browser/animations".

- Add the "BrowserAnimationsModule" to the "imports" array.

```typescript
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';

// . . .

imports: [
    // . . .
    BrowserAnimationsModule,
],
```

### STEP 2: Adding a Swoop Animation

_library/book-results/book-results.component.ts file_:

- Add the "animations" array to the `@Component({})` decorator config.

- Create a new `trigger()` that is called "swoopIn".

- This animation should use the state "in" to have the element eventually be the normal size and full opacity.

- Add the `transition()` method that listens for the ":enter" event and animates using keyframes the "transform", "opacity", and "offset" properties from 0 to 1.

- _NOTE_: Be sure to import `{ animate, keyframes, state, style, transition, trigger }` from "@angular/animations".

```typescript
animations: [
    trigger('swoopIn', [
      state(
        'in',
        style({
          transform: 'scale(1)',
          opacity: 1,
        })
      ),
      transition(':enter', [
        animate(
          '1s',
          keyframes([
            style({
              transform: 'scale(0)',
              opacity: 0,
              offset: 0,
            }),
            style({
              transform: 'scale(.3)',
              opacity: 0.3,
              offset: 0.2,
            }),
            style({
              transform: 'scale(.6)',
              opacity: 0.6,
              offset: 0.4,
            }),
            style({
              transform: 'scale(.9)',
              opacity: 0.9,
              offset: 0.8,
            }),
            style({
              transform: 'scale(1)',
              opacity: 1,
              offset: 1,
            }),
          ])
        ),
      ]),
    ]),
],
```

_library/book-results/book-results.component.html_:

- Inside the opening tag of the outer-most `<div>`, add the binding for the "swoopIn" animation.

```html
<div class="row mb-3" *ngIf="bookResults.length > 0" [@swoopIn]>
  <!-- . . . -->
</div>
```

## Service Workers && PWA - Course Project Steps

### STEP 1: Setting up Angular PWA Functionality

_Terminal_:

- Use the Angular CLI to add `@angular/pwa` to the project.

- Globally Install a lightweight node server by running `npm i -g http-server`.

- Build the project for production.

- Change directories into the "dist/PROJECTNAME/browser" folder

- Run "http-server".

```zsh
ng add @angular/pwa
# . . .
npm i -g http-server
# . . .
ng build
# . . .
cd dist/PROJECTNAME/browser
# . . .
http-server
```

- _NOTE_: To see if it installed, refresh the page and check the "Application" tab in developer tools and select "Service Workers".
