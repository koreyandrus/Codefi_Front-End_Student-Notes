2. **How to setup a deploy when you commit to Github**

## Deployment - Project Steps

### STEP 1: Installing Developer Dependencies

_Terminal_:

- Install "express" (a package for create nodeJS servers)

- Check your version of "node" and "npm" by running two commands. Save these values for later.

```zsh
npm install express
# . . .
node -v
# . . .
npm -v
```

---

### STEP 2: Adding a Build Script && Engines

_package.json file_:

- Add a new script under the "build" script called "heroku-postbuild". Set it to run the code "ng build". Heroku will be looking for this script.

- Change the "start" script to run "node server.js"... a file we will create in the next step.

- Under the "devDependencies" object, add a new property "engines" that is set to an object containing the "node" and "npm" versions gathered earlier.

- _Note_: If the versions you have are throwing errors, paste these in: `"@angular/cli": "^12.2.1", "@angular/compiler-cli": "^12.1.5", "typescript": "~4.3.2"` and run `npm i`.

```json
{
  "name": "book-app",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "node server.js",
    "build": "ng build",
    "heroku-postbuild": "ng build",
    "watch": "ng build --watch --configuration development",
    "test": "ng test"
  },
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@angular/animations": "~12.1.2",
    "@angular/common": "~12.1.2",
    "@angular/compiler": "~12.1.2",
    "@angular/core": "~12.1.2",
    "@angular/forms": "~12.1.2",
    "@angular/platform-browser": "~12.1.2",
    "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "~12.1.2",
    "@angular/router": "~12.1.2",
    "bootstrap": "^4.6.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "path": "^0.12.7",
    "rxjs": "~6.6.0",
    "tslib": "^2.2.0",
    "zone.js": "~0.11.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@angular-devkit/build-angular": "~12.1.2",
    "@angular/cli": "^12.2.10",
    "@angular/compiler-cli": "~12.1.2",
    "@types/jasmine": "~3.8.0",
    "@types/node": "^12.11.1",
    "jasmine-core": "~3.8.0",
    "karma": "~6.3.0",
    "karma-chrome-launcher": "~3.1.0",
    "karma-coverage": "~2.0.3",
    "karma-jasmine": "~4.0.0",
    "karma-jasmine-html-reporter": "~1.7.0",
    "typescript": "~4.3.2"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "16.5.0",
    "npm": "7.20.0"
  }
}
```

### STEP 3: Creating the Express Server

_server.js file_:

- Inside the root of the application, create a new file called "server.js".

- This file should import the "express" and "path" packages, initialize `express()`, serve the static build files from the "dist" folder, route incoming server requests to the correct location, and listen on a new port.

- _Note_: To find out the projects name, run "ng build" in the terminal and check the file located directly under the "dist" directory.

```javascript
// Import Express Package
const express = require("express");

// Initialize express
const app = express();

// Serve static build files from the "dist" directory
app.use(express.static("./dist/PROJECTNAME"));

// Route incoming server requests to the correct files
app.get("/*", (req, res) =>
  res.sendFile("index.html", { root: "dist/PROJECTNAME/" })
);

// Start the app on the default Heroku port
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8080);
```

- _Note_: Push the new code to GitHub!

### STEP 4 - Hooking Up Heroku

_Heroku Website_:

- In the browser, head on over to [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/).

- Create an account.

- Create a new app.

- In the "Deployment Method" tab, choose the "Connect to GitHub" option.

- Select the repository the main project is located inside.

- Enable Automatic Deploys.

- Click Deploy Branch.

- _NOTE:_ The GitHub connection method no longer works. You will need to install the Heroku CLI and follow the steps provided. Ensure you add the environment variable in Heroku Settings if you used it in your project!
