# Class 27 - Review Day

## Concepts

- **HTTP:** _Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol_ is the webs standard for transfering data between networked devises. A typical flow using HTTP involves a client/user making an HTTP Request to a server in order to get an HTTP Response of the pages HTML, CSS & JS.

- **API:** An _Application Programming Interface_ is a set of data or functions that is accessible to third-party developers. This allows companies or individuals to communicate with each other and leverage each other's data through documentation. API's are critical to learn as a developer... you will use them a lot!

- **CRUD:** _Create | Read | Update | Delete_ are the features every application usually needs to implement to make a working application. We do this by sending specific HTTP requests to a server.

- **Firebase:** _Firebase_ is a "BaaS" (Backend as a Service) created by Google to make it easier to do all things backend. (Realtime Databases, File Storage, Authentication, Hosting. . .)

- **Authentication:** _Authentication_ is the process of verifying the identity of an individual. Authenticating a user results in user information and access to certain actions or pages that would be restricted otherwise.

- **RESTful API:** A _REST API_ (Representational State Transfer Architectural Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style and a set of rules for working with an API in a specific way. Using "RESTful Architecture", every incoming API request for the same source should ook the same, no matter where it is coming from.

- **JSON Web Token:** A _JSON Web Token_ is a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON Object. They are an encrypted tokens that can be sent from client to server safely.

- **Dynamic Components:** _Dynamic Components_ are components whose location isn't defined at buildtime and are loaded programmatically through code.

- **Modules:** In Angular, _Modules_ are a great way to organize an application and extend it's capabilities. They are cohesive blocks of functionality comprised of components, directives, and pipes to focus on a specific feature or area of an application.

- **Code-Splitting:** _Code-Splitting_ is the process of splitting code "chunks" into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand or in parallel.

- **Lazy-Loading:** _Lazy-Loading_ is a strategy to identify non-critical resources and than load those features or assets only when needed.

- **Ahead-of-Time-Compliation:** _AOT Compliation_ is the act of compiling higher-level programming languages into a lower-level language before execution of a program to reduce the amount of work need to be performed at run time.

- **PWA:** A _Progressive Web App (PWA)_ is a web application that has the feel and functionality of an actual native/mobile phone app. PWA's are also enhanced with modern API's to deliver advanced features such as the ability for a user to install the website on any device.

- **Service Worker:** A _Service Worker_ is a script that the browser downloads and runs in the background, seperate from the main thread of the webpage, opening the door to features that don't need to work with the webpage or user interaction. These features include, but are not limited to, _push notifications_, _background sync_, and supporting offline experiences!
